I have created an application that allows me to upload medical images of patients, with information such as:

Medical Image Upload
Image Code
Image Description
Insert Image
Upload Date: (enter a date in the format DD-MM-YYYY)
Analysis Results

Subsequently, I can search for the image in the system based on the code assigned to it. 


There is also a section for SCINTIGRAPHY (Nuclear Medicine Images), where I can upload nuclear images with information such as the radioactive substance (Technetium IOD Fluor).
Patient Name
ID

It is possible to generate signatures for the images, and they can be searched in the system based on the color importance coefficient, texture coefficient, shape coefficient, and location coefficient.
